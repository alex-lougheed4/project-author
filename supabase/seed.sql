She had been studying rare plant species when she stumbled upon a hidden greenhouse in the university''s botanical gardens. Inside, she found plants that defied all known botanical classifications. There was a tree with leaves that whispered forgotten lullabies, a vine that grew in the shape of mathematical equations, and flowers that bloomed in colors that didn''t exist in nature. Each plant was connected to a human dream that had been abandoned or forgotten. The garden was tended by an elderly woman who called herself the Gardener of Lost Hopes. She explained that the garden served as a repository for dreams that people had given up on. "Sometimes," she said, "just seeing their dream in physical form gives people the courage to try again." Isabella had started her own research project, documenting each plant and trying to understand how dreams could manifest as living things.

But now, suddenly, Marcus was alone in his own mind. He couldn''t hear anyone else''s thoughts, and no one could hear his. At first, he thought he was going crazy. He tried to concentrate, to reach out with his mind as he had always done. But there was nothing. Just silence. He went to the doctor, who was baffled. "This has never happened before," the doctor said, his thoughts completely silent to Marcus. "You''re the first person to lose their telepathic abilities." Marcus realized that he was now completely isolated. He couldn''t communicate with anyone except through speech, which felt clumsy and inadequate. But as the days passed, he began to appreciate the silence. For the first time, he could think his own thoughts without interference. He could have private moments. He could be alone with his own mind. He started to wonder if maybe the telepathy had been a curse rather than a gift. Maybe true connection came from choice, not from forced mental intimacy. He began to learn sign language and other forms of non-verbal communication. And slowly, he started to build genuine relationships based on mutual understanding rather than mental invasion.', 320, NOW(), NOW());
